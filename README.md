## Hi there üëã

### About me üìã

üìñ I graduated from Poznan University of Technology with a degree in Automatic Control and Robotics, with a focus on robotics. 

üíª I am currently a software engineer with about a year of experience.

‚òÄÔ∏è My major areas of interest include artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and machine learning.

üå± I try to grow as a person by immersing myself in various fields, and this is where I publish my personal projects.
